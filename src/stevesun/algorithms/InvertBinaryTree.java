Trivia:
This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:

    Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canï¿½t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.*/

	//the recursive version which is O(h), h is the height of the tree since recursion might place h recursive calls on the stack
